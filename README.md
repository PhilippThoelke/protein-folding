# Protein folding

It is possible to predict the tertiary/quaternary structure of proteins using so called molecular dynamics simulations. Unfortunately, these simulations are computationally very expensive and take a lot of time to reach meaningful results, especially for larger proteins. The goal of this project is to reduce the computational power needed to run protein structure predictions, building upon the idea of a molecular dynamics simulation.

### The project is currently at a very early stage!

Implemented so far:
- Molecular dynamics simulation using OpenMM, theoretically capable of folding a protein, i.e. finding the native state, given the protein's primary structure.
- Non gradient based genetic algorithm approach, which optimizes the angles between neighbouring amino acids inside a molecular dynamics simulation with OpenMM. Evaluation is based on the protein's potential energy in the thermodynamic system. It currently does not work properly because the molecular dynamics simulation runs into numerical problems due to large forces applied to the system.
- Gradient descent optimization, minimizing the spatial error of covalent atomic bonds and non-covalent atomic forces. Bonds and forces are parsed from an AMBER forcefield. The gradient is computed on the locations of individual atoms in three-dimensional space using TensorFlow. Optimization does not leverage all computational resources of a system yet, performance improvements should be possible.
- A direct approach moving atoms directly based on the error of certain atomic bonds. The idea is somewhat similar to the idea of a physics based molecular dynamics simulation but instead of realistically modelling the velocities and forces involved in the system, atom positions are directly updated using the current bond error. The efficiency of this approach is greatly improved by preprocessing the atomic bonds in the amino acid chain, i.e. finding all atoms that should be moved in a certain direction to reduce the error of one bond while keeping the error of other bonds constant. This preprocessing step is applied to all harmonic bonds, significantly reducing the number of optimization steps needed to minimize the error. Since both angle and distance of atomic bonds are optimized, multiple steps are necessary to achieve low errors because adjusting bond angles might affect the distance between two atoms in a different bond and vice versa. It can also leverage the power of multithreading, since the adjustments of atom positions do not depend on one another. The approach currently lacks any non-bonded atomic interactions which are necessary for correct protein folding.
